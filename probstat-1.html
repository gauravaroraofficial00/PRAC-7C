    <h2>Features of NoSQL Databases:</h2>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Document databases:<br>
            They store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each
            document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including
            things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects, and their structures typically align with
            objects developers are working with in code. Because of their variety of field value types and powerful
            query languages, document databases are great for a wide variety of use cases and can be used as a general
            purpose database. They can horizontally scale-out to accomodate large data volumes. MongoDB is consistently
            ranked as the world’s most popular NoSQL database according to DB-engines and is an example of a document
            database. For more on document databases, visit What is a Document Database?.</li>
        <li>Key-value databases:<br> are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values. A value
            can
            typically only be retrieved by referencing its key, so learning how to query for a specific key-value pair
            is typically simple. Key-value databases are great for use cases where you need to store large amounts of
            data but you don’t need to perform complex queries to retrieve it. Common use cases include storing user
            preferences or caching. Redis and DynanoDB are popular key-value databases.</li>
        <li>Wide-column: <br> stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns. Wide-column stores provide a lot
            of
            flexibility over relational databases because each row is not required to have the same columns. Many
            consider wide-column stores to be two-dimensional key-value databases. Wide-column stores are great for when
            you need to store large amounts of data and you can predict what your query patterns will be. Wide-column
            stores are commonly used for storing Internet of Things data and user profile data. Cassandra and HBase are
            two of the most popular wide-column stores.</li>
        <li>Graph databases:<br> store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places,
            and
            things while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes. Graph databases excel in use
            cases where you need to traverse relationships to look for patterns such as social networks, fraud
            detection, and recommendation engines. Neo4j and JanusGraph are examples of graph databases.</li>
